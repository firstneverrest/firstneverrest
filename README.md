Hi There, I'm a junior student majoring in Computer Science at Chulalongkorn Univeristy in search of a front-end developer internship.
My journey began in December 2020, when I was interested in web development. After that, I started learning about website from scratch. From basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript to React and other libraries and framework. I'm a fast learner which can understand fundamental of web development in only a few months. 

After my web development skills are good enough, I have a plan to step up my game. First, I would like to be a front-end developer to understand how can I create a good UX/UI website. Next, I would like to be a back-end developer to understand how to manage API, manipulate database and cooperate with front-end developer. Finally, I would like to be a full-stack developer which make me have all skills about web development from beginning to end.✨
